42 Common Core Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of all the projects that I have coded as part of the Common Core curriculum at 42 School. It serves as a chronological and comprehensive archive of my journey through the rigorous and challenging projects that define the foundation of the 42 educational program.

Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific project, from early fundamentals to advanced topics. These projects cover a wide range of concepts, including algorithms, data structures, system-level programming, memory management, and more.

The goal of this repository is not only to showcase the work completed but also to serve as a resource for anyone interested in understanding or reviewing the various projects that make up the 42 curriculum. As I progress, I will continue to update this repository to include all new projects.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the different approaches, and see how each project contributes to building a solid foundation in software engineering.
